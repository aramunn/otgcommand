# OTG Command

Addon for Wildstar for Commanding Guild and Raids.

Initially focused on OTG DKP tracking and deduplication of Player Toon Roster.

## Installation

Download zip version.
Extract it to addons directory.

## Usage

- /otg brings up addon
- /otgreset resets addon saved data on next reload

Addon needs data from the guildroster, the wildstar game typically polls this about once every few minutes.  You can force it immediately by visiting the guild roster in the ingame social tab (o).
